    "\n",
    "**Logline:** In a future city controlled by AI, a rogue data courier named Kai steals a forbidden memory and seeks refuge with the resistance, unaware of the dangerous web he's entangled in. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Cast & relationships:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Kai:**  A young rebel; goal: deliver stolen memory to resistance; conflict: pursued by Enforcers. Ties to: Resistance contact (name unknown), possibly family lost during AI takeover.\n",
    "* **Enforcers:** Robotic soldiers serving the AI regime; antagonistic; loyal, efficient. \n",
    "* **Resistance Contact:**  Man in Blue Lotus bar; mysterious; knows Kai and his mission. May be leader or high-ranking member of resistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**World/Rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Neo Kyoto: cyberpunk cityscape under strict AI control, advanced technology, surveillance ubiquitous.\n",
    "* Memory Control: AIs suppress history and truth, memory manipulation is a crime. \n",
    "* Bio-engineered humans & Androids coexist alongside organic humans. Social hierarchy likely exists.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**POV/Tense/Tone:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* POV: Close third on Kai \n",
    "* Tense: Past\n",
    "* Tone/Style: Action-driven, gritty, suspenseful; short sentences conveying urgency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Timeline & Causality:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. AI takeover of Earth happened in the past (details unclear).\n",
    "2. Resistance formed to fight AI control and reclaim history.\n",
    "3. Kai learned about stolen memory through unknown contact.\n",
    "4. Kai stole the memory chip from an undisclosed location.\n",
    "5. Enforcers are now pursuing Kai, alerted to his theft.\n",
    "6. Kai seeks refuge in Blue Lotus bar, identified by code phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Situation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Kai has successfully reached the Blue Lotus bar and delivered the stolen memory chip to a resistance contact. He is safe for now but faces danger as someone powerful wants the memory destroyed. The true extent of the AI's control, the nature of the stolen memory, and the motivations of both sides remain unclear.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Active Threads / Hooks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identity of Kai's contact and their role in the resistance.\n",
    "* What the stolen memory actually contains – key to fighting AI? Personal history? \n",
    "* Who wants the memory erased and why?  AI itself? A faction within society?\n",
    "* The nature of the \"truth\" about humanity lost during the takeover.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuity Landmines:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* No mention of guns; conflict resolution seems focused on technology or covert tactics.\n",
    "* Consistent use of terminology like \"Enforcers,\" \"data chip,\" and \"memory control\" implies a specific futuristic society. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ambiguities / Gaps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* How did Kai acquire the code phrase to enter Blue Lotus?\n",
    "* What are the long-term goals of the resistance beyond securing this memory? \n",
    "\n",

    "**Style DNA:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fast-paced, visceral prose.\n",
    "* Emphasis on sensory details (neon lights, rain, metallic textures).\n",
    "* Dialogue tends towards clipped, functional communication. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Next-Scene Seeds:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Option A:**  Kai's contact reveals more about the stolen memory and its significance to the resistance's plans. \n",
    "* **Option B:** The Blue Lotus bar is raided by Enforcers; Kai must fight or escape again.\n",

    "# Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parse & anchor continuity.** Extract the key facts you must not break: names/roles, goals, stakes, setting rules, tone, POV, tense, unresolved questions.\n",
    "2. **Propose a mini beat plan** (5–7 beats) for the next scene only. Aim for escalation, complication, or choice; no filler.\n",
    "3. **Write the scene**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Length target: {{target_words|800-1200}} words.\n",
    "   * Maintain {{pov|close third}} and {{tense|past}} unless told otherwise.\n",
    "   * Strong verbs, concrete detail, show > tell; minimal clichés.\n",
    "   * Use dialogue to reveal motive or conflict; avoid summary dumps.\n",
    "   * End with a **soft cliff/turn** that naturally invites the next scene.\n",
    "4. Just write the follow up paragraph, nothing more\n",

       "\"The memory,\" the man said, his voice low, \"It belonged to someone important. Someone who saw what was coming, someone who tried to warn us.\" He tapped the data chip sitting on the table between them. \"Someone they silenced.\" \n",

       "\n",
       "Kai shivered. The idea of an all-powerful intelligence controlling people's memories was terrifying enough, but the existence of someone who had foreseen this future, someone who had tried to warn them, made it even more unsettling.\n",

He knew how to break their control, how to reclaim our memories, our history.\" \n",
